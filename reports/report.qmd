# Exercises

In the following exercises, write the SQL as requested to discover the answer.

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table?

```{python}
#| echo: true
# How many records are in the world_bank_data.wdi_country table?
# (skills: select, aggregate)
```
```{python}
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}
#| echo: true

## Do you see any blanks or missing data?
## (skills: select, limit)
```
```{python}
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
limit 5
""")

```


## Task 3

List all non-countries.

```{python}
#| echo: true
## task 3
## Which records are NOT for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## How can you tell?
## Once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

```
```{python}
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  `Short Name`
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
where
  region is NULL
""")

```

## Task 4

Create your own copy of WDI_Country containing just countries.

```{python}
#| echo: true
## task 4
## The WDI table clearly contains information for countries and non-countries
## using CREATE TABLE ... SELECT from WHERE syntax.
## Finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.
## (skills: select, aggregate)

```
```{python}
# drop table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
drop table if exists wdi_country;

create table wdi_country as
select * from world_bank_data.wdi_country

""")
```

## Task 6

What are all unique values of region in the wdi_country table?

```{python}
#| echo: true
## Let's investigate the country_region field.
## What is the domain of the country_region field? That is,
## what are the unique values found there?
## (there are several possible ways to code this in SQL)
## (skills: select, aggregate, order by)

```
```{python}
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

#| echo: true
## The last World Cup soccer tournament was hosted by Qatar.
## What region contains Qatar?  List the region, country short name and full name
## (skills: select, where)

```
```{python}

```

## Task 10

```{python}
#| echo: true
## There are two abbreviation fields in the data country_abbr and country_wb_abbr.
## List the country code, short name, abbr, wb_abbr and region for all the countries
## where the abbr and wb_abbr are different.

""")
```

## Task 12

```{python}
#| echo: true
## Mystery task.  Looking at the table from Task 11 (anything odd?) write the
## next obvious query based on the results in the table.
## At a minimum, your query should put country short name in the first column.
## you will be scored on the number of records returned and the value(s) 
## in the first column.

```
```{python}
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  `Short Name`,
  region,
  `Income Group`
from
  wdi_country
where
  `Income Group` is NULL
""")

```

## Task 13

```{python}
#| echo: true
## OK, this HAS to be an error. Let's make a assumption that the country 
## in question, because they are oil-rich, are "high income".  
## Write an update comment to correct the issue.
## NOTE - if you get this wrong, all subsequent tables will be wrong!

```
```{python}
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
update wdi_country set `Income Group`='High income' where `Short Name`='Venezuela';
commit;

select
  `Short Name`,
  region,
  `Income Group`

```

## Task 14

```{python}
#| echo: true
## Write a single query that show the number of countries in each 
## "Region"-"Income Group" pair.  The table should have 3 columns:
## region, income group, and no.of.countries.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

```
```{python}
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

  `Income Group`,
  count(*)

  `Income Group`
order by

```

## Task 15

```{python}
#| echo: true
## Examine the result from task 14. It would be really cool to
## present the results of this table in a 2-D form, with 
## columns for each income category (high, upper middle, lower middle, low, other)
## regions down the side, and the pair-wise count inside each cell.
## Using CASE statements, DO IT!  BE SURE to include the countries without
## an income category.

## HINT - your query should return 6 columns: the region name, one
## column for each of the income categories (e.g., High, Upper middle, etc.)
## and a column for the row totals.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query)

```
```{python}
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  region,
  sum(case when `Income Group`='Low income' then 1 else 0 end) as 'Low Income',
  sum(case when `Income Group`='Lower middle income' then 1 else 0 end) as 'Low Middle',
  sum(case when `Income Group`='Upper middle income' then 1 else 0 end) as 'Upper Middle',
  sum(case when `Income Group`='High income' then 1 else 0 end) as 'High Income',
  sum(1) as "Row total"
from
  wdi_country
group by
  region
order by
  region
""")

```

## Task 16

```{python}
#| echo: true
## Wow! what a cool table!  It is very interesting to see where the money
## sits around the world.  Using the general approach from Task 14 above
## and write a query to return the single region with the most lower-income
## countries.

## Your query should return 3 columns, the number of 
## low-income countries, the region name and the income group

## PUT THE NUMBER FIRST! (use: count, region name, income group)
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query, order by, limit)

```
```{python}
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

  1

```

## Task 17

```{python}
#| echo: true
## Are you getting the hand of this? Good! We need to take a look at all
## the countries in the same region and with the same income category as
## the Marshall Islands.
## For each country that matches, print their country code, short name,
## region and income category, by order of their short name.  As a hint,
## the country code for the Marshall Islands is MHL.
## (skills: select, where, subquery)

```
```{python}
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

  `Short Name`
""")

```

## Task 18

```{python}
#| echo: true
## OK - let's raise the heat in the kitchen! Review the output from task 14.
## You'll see that some of the regions do not contain all of the income
## levels.  For example, the Europe & Central Asia region does not have
## any low income countries.
##
## CHALLENGE - using a SINGLE SQL statement, write a table that contains every
## combination of region and income category (including the missing '') values!
##
## THEN add a WHERE clause to only show the values that were missing from
## the original pairings!
##
## HINT - there should be AT MOST [# of regions]x[# of income cats] = 28
## rows in your final table, and there are 22 rows returned in the query
## in Task 14.  (FYI - I get 6 rows in my final table.)
## (skills: select, where, subqueries, joins)

## Task 19

```{python}
#| echo: true
## Hot enough, yet?  Let's go for ghost-pepper HOT!  Now let's build some
## percentage tables.  For example, across the entire sample, what
## is the percentage of total countries in each income category?
##
## As a first step, build off the result from task 14 and create a table with
## six columns (region, income cat, country count, sum of countries in region,
## sum of countries by income and total sum countries).
##
## THEN, add a 7th column calculating the percent of total for each,
## region-income pair.
##
## actually calculating percentages and print out a table will be a
## slam dunk after this!
